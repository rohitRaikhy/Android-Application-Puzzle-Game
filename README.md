Our game is a single-player board game that includes fantasy elements. At each level, the game will initiate our hero at the bottom of the board, and the hero’s objective is to reach the treasure chest, which is placed somewhere at the top of the screen. The hero will use various tactics to achieve his goal and will be tested on their ability to avoid traps and optimize stamina along their way to the treasure chest. As the hero clears the current level, they will move on to a more difficult level.

The gameplay allows the user to choose between different difficulty levels of puzzles. The screenshot shown is the easiest level of the game. To reach the treasure chest the user must conserve stamina and not get taken by the grim reaper. If the user reaches the treasure chest unscathed the user can progress to the next level.
